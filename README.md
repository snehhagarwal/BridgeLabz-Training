## Day 52 - February 23, 2026 - Quantity Measurement App (UC-6 to UC-7) 📅                 
**What I Learned:** 📚                                

- UC-6: Addition of two length units 🏙️                         
- UC7: Addition with Target Unit Specification 🗄️                                             
- Handles same-unit and cross-unit addition and maintains immutability, commutativity, and precision. 🌐                                                   
- Uses method overloading and private utility method for clean, DRY implementation. 🧠
