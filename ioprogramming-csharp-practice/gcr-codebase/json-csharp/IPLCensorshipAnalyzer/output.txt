I have completed all the requested code modifications and version changes. The project now builds successfully with .NET 10.0.

When you run the application and enter '1' for "Process CSV file", the following will occur:

1.  The `IPLCensorshipAnalyzer.Processors.IplCsvProcessor.ProcessCsv()` method will be executed.
2.  It will read the `ipl.csv` file located in the `Data` directory.
3.  The team names in columns 1, 2, and 5 will be masked, and column 6 (player of match) will be redacted to "REDACTED".
4.  A new file named `ipl_censored.csv` will be created in the `Data` directory, containing the processed data.
5.  A message "CSV processing complete." will be printed to the console.

When you run the application and enter '2' for "Process JSON file", the following will occur:

1.  The `IPLCensorshipAnalyzer.Processors.IplJsonProcessor.ProcessJson()` method will be executed.
2.  It will read the `ipl.json` file located in the `Data` directory.
3.  The `Team1`, `Team2`, `Winner` properties of `IplMatch` objects will be masked, and `PlayerOfMatch` will be redacted to "REDACTED". The keys in the `Score` dictionary will also be masked.
4.  A new file named `ipl_censored.json` will be created in the `Data` directory, containing the processed data.
5.  A message "JSON processing complete." will be printed to the console.

You can now run the application yourself and interact with it.
